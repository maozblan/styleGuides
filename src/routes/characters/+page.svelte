<h1>charactersss</h1>

<p>
	this is the messiest part of the style. feel free to design the characters
	however you like. do refer to the player character (at the bottom of this
	page) to ground your design. alien designs can be wack though, make it feel
	galactic :)
</p>
<p>
	please pay attention to if the character is to be front facing, back facing,
	or both.
</p>

<br />

<p>requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>150px wide is a good starting point, much recommended</li>
	<li>
		all characters in the same set/group should have THE SAME ASPECT RATIO and
		SVG size
	</li>
	<li>characters in the same group should look reasonably similar</li>
	<li>
		they can be relatively more complicated but do not go overboard with the
		design/colors, simple and blocky is the main style
	</li>
	<li>
		feel free to use a little bit of extra off-palette colors (1 to 3 inclusive)
		to distingush characters
	</li>
	<li>no use of path outlines (they will get messed up)</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>
	all customer characters are to be drawn back-facing the camera unless
	otherwise specified.
