<h1>items and icons</h1>

<p>
	this is a list of all the things that should be used near text. style should
	be a slightly simplier version of how characters are drawn.
</p>
<p>
	items are icons are usually one in the same though icons tend to be displayed
	smaller.
</p>

<br />

<p>requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>100x100px or 150x150px unless specified otherwise</li>
	<li>only use solid block colors with minimal gradients</li>
	<li>easily recognizable at a glance (unique enough silhouettes)</li>
	<li>simple designs but leave enough room for variation such as upgrades</li>
	<li>NO use of path outlines unless specified otherwise</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>there are currently no examples... sorry.</p>
