<h1>start start start</h1>

<p>things to always note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		everything needs to be an SVG, if you don't have an app you can use <a
			href="https://provector.app/"
			target="_blank">provector</a
		> online
	</li>
	<li>
		sizes are to be relatively small (see individual sections for sizes)
		probably just stay under 300x300px or 500x500px if really necessary
	</li>
	<li>when in doubt, make it simple</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>
	SVG animations are currently NOT supported, but if you want to do SVG
	animations i can and will figure it out for you.
</p>
<p>
	if you want simple movement of the image for enhanced effect, let me know how
	you want it to move and i will do it in CSS.
</p>

<br />

<p>
	all assets requested are to be placed on <a
		href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2C6I-_AR3sh6fM6S3EfySXXskuLsS2Ft9eP6QDwfXI/edit?usp=sharing"
		target="_blank">this spreedsheet</a
	>.
</p>
<p>
	ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS update the spreedsheet with your status so i don't come
	after you for stuff you've already finished.
</p>
<p>
	please place completed assets in the src/assets folder. if they are a set of
	assets, feel free to make a subfolder for them. thank you.
</p>
<p>
	if you believe the game needs more assets, feel free to contact me or just add
	it to the spreadsheet.
</p>

<br />

<p>rest of the information can be found by using the nav bar to your left.</p>
<p>good luck, have fun, and thank you :D</p>

<br />

<p>
	if you have questions, ask early. if you have more questions, ask more. do not
	worry about bothering me.
